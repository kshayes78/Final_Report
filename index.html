  <div class="header">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</div>
  <div class="content">
   <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
   <p>The purpose of this project is to investigate wage inequities and the lack of BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) representation within the technology field. Based on our findings, the disparities within the technology industry are statistically significant. BIPOC employees within this career sector show significantly lower representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles in comparison to their peers of different races. In addition to excluding potentially fresh talent, the lack of diversity within the tech industry can also leave current minority technology professionals feeling marginalized and less motivated to contribute to their highest capacity within their respective departments.

</p>
</div>
<div>

<h2>GOALS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Highlight the differences in earnings for BIPOC tech employees</li>
    <li>Investigate potential contributing factors such as education level, years of experience (YOE), and job location
    </li>
    <li>Develop an action plan for hiring managers and senior leadership to eliminate selection bias in hiring and promoting BIPOC employees
   <li>Increase BIPOC representation within tech fields</li> 

    </li>
    <!-- <li>Increase access to career coaching, salary negotiation techniques, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers
    </li>
    <li>Encourage employer transparency in regard to salary range when posting new employment opportunities to reduce salary underbidding</li> -->

<h2>IMPACT</h2>
    <li>Improve the number of BIPOC employees in terms of representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles</li>
    <li>Increase awareness of STEM internship and employment opportunities to BIPOC audiences</li>
    <li>Increase sense of belonging in diverse talent and current technology professionals to feel less marginalized, and more motivated to contribute.
    </li>
    <li>Commitment from all levels of the organization to adhere to diversity and inclusion initiatives within the workplace. 
    </li>

<div class="header">DATA ANALYSIS</div>
<h2>DATASETS</h2>
<p>The team identified three data sources relevant to job role, median salary, and employee demographics. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each data set,
    determined the relevant factors, and performed a preliminary analysis to determine if salary inequalities were apparent.  Data sourcing proved to be challenging, and the group found that data specific to “data scientist” was quite limited relative to what we desired. For this reason, the initial project focus was amended to include additional technology roles such as software engineer and business analyst.

<h2>DATA WRANGLING</h2>
<p>The team's primary goal during the data wrangling process was to ensure that data from various sources could be merged and that the information relevant to the relationship between race/ethnicity, employee representation, and salary projection were clearly illustrated. The resulting database would then serve as input for the dashboard and end-user tool.
</p>
<h2>VALIDATION</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Data points with null values were
    dropped
    </li>
   <li>Data points with salaries below $50,000 per annum were eliminated
</li>
   <li>Columns were renamed for clarity and uniformity
</li>
  <li>Race/Ethnicity values other than White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic were eliminated</li>
</ul>

<div class="header">EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS</div>
<div class="page">
<p>We projected that the disparities within the tech industry are significant. For the purpose of this analysis, our team sampled three tech-related job titles:  “Data Scientist”, “Business Analyst'', and “Software Engineer”. We found that minorities (Blacks and Hispanics) lag behind their non-minority peers the job title of "Data Scientist" and Software Engineer. Outside of excluding potential fresh talent, lack of diversity and inclusion within the data science industry can leave current data science professionals feeling isolated, ostracized and suffering from “imposter syndrome”.

 <p>In order to answer this question, we need a better understanding of our data accomplished by
  exploring the basic statistics of each variable and the relationships between features.</p> 

  <h2>U.S Census: Income Summary Measures by Selected Characteristics 2021</h2>

  <p>This dataset is structured with regard to income in the United States highlighting various factors such as race, household composition, age and education. Initial findings show that the dataset can be used independently as well as supplementally along with the Quick Facts dataset, as that dataset focuses primarily on the selected cities with tech hubs. Independent findings showcase median income under racial disparities across the United States for the year 2021.</p>
  
   <h2>U.S Census: Households by Total Money Income, Race, and Hispanic Origin of Householder ~ 2010 to 2021</h2>

  <p>In this dataset, each row is uniquely identified by the “race and hispanic origin of householder by year”, “income”, and “median income”, and “mean income”  columns, meaning the dataset contains one row for each household’s reported race and relevant year, total income for each relevant year, and both median and mean income in dollars for each year. There are 100 unique rows (for race and year) and 15 unique columns for income.</p>

  <p>This dataset extracts information from Levels.fyi, a website dedicated to helping every professional build a better career through the highest integrity insights and services. The dataset presents a bulk of information based on survey response information including: race, salary (total compensation along with bonuses/stock options, education levels, years at current company, total years of experience, location, title the employee currently holds, and the company the employee currently works for. This dataset has over 42,000 unique rows and presents a wealth of information. With this dataset, we were able to answer questions on pay disparity in terms of race, location, and title for various roles in the technology industry, and customize to extract the data relevant to a specific company.</p>

<p>The front-end dashboard provides a graphical representation of our business problem. The primary stakeholders of this tool are employers, specifically hiring managers and human resources professionals within the tech industry, and current employees.</p>
<p>Secondary users of this dashboard would include potential job-seekers and college students currently majoring in STEM fields.</p>

<div class="header">CONCLUSION</div>
<div class="page">
  <p>"The Color of Tech" highlights the need for increased access to STEM-related educational opportunities for the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) community. To reduce bias and discrimination in the tech industry, the project results recommend promoting diversity and inclusion efforts in hiring practices and initial salary offers. Our further suggestions are to leverage social media to share funded opportunities for technology education, training, and internships aimed at increasing minority representation in tech workspaces. We also recommend increasing access to career coaching, advice on salary negotiation, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers. Additionally, our findings suggest employer transparency in regards to salary range when posting new employment opportunities in order to eliminate salary underbidding for BIPOC job applicants. These recommendations aim to address the disparities in the representation, salaries, and leadership positions of BIPOC individuals in the tech industry.
