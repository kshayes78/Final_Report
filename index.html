  <div class="header">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</div>
  <div class="content">
   <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
   <p>The purpose of this project is to investigate wage inequities and the lack of BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) representation within the technology field. Based on our findings, the disparities within the technology industry are statistically significant. BIPOC employees within this career sector show significantly lower representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles in comparison to their peers of different races. In addition to excluding potentially fresh talent, the lack of diversity within the tech industry can also leave current minority technology professionals feeling marginalized and less motivated to contribute to their greatest capacity within their respective departments. Furthermore, the inclusion of BIPOC talent within the data science field, particularly in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning projects, can enhance the design and development of new products and services. BIPOC contributors can offer valuable insights to assist in diversifying product offerings to broaden a company's customer base. 
</p>

<h2>SCOPE</h2>
<p>DS4A Empowerment Team 47 sought to analyze the wage inequities and underrepresentation of BIPOC employees and  within the tech industry. To accomplish this task, we utilized survey data from the US Census Bureau and Levels.fyi. See datafolio <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HFqtOUKcGNnHBI3gqQ7CyBGq7ADdHmzry_LLoPphCS4/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> </p>

<h2>GOALS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Highlight the differences in earnings for BIPOC tech employees</li>
    <li>Investigate potential contributing factors such as education level, years of experience (YOE), and job location
    </li>
    <li>Develop an action plan for hiring managers and senior leadership to eliminate selection bias in hiring and promoting BIPOC employees
 

    </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <li>Increase access to career coaching, salary negotiation techniques, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers
    </li>
    <li>Encourage employer transparency in regard to salary range when posting new employment opportunities to reduce salary underbidding</li> -->

<h2>IMPACT</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Improve the number of BIPOC employees in terms of representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles</li>
    <li>Increase awareness of STEM internship and employment opportunities to BIPOC audiences</li>
    <li>Increase sense of belonging in diverse talent and current technology professionals to feel less marginalized, and more motivated to contribute.
    </li>
    <li>Commitment from all levels of the organization to adhere to diversity and inclusion initiatives within the workplace.

     </table>
<p>The team identified three data sources relevant to job role, median salary, and employee demographics. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each data set,
    determined the relevant factors, and performed a preliminary analysis to determine if salary inequalities were apparent.  Data sourcing proved to be challenging, and the group found that data specific to “data scientist” was quite limited relative to what we desired. For this reason, the initial project focus was amended to include additional technology roles such as software engineer and business analyst.
    
    </p>
  </div>
<h2>DATA WRANGLING</h2>
<p>The team's primary goal during the data wrangling process was to ensure that data from various sources could be merged and that the information relevant to the relationship between race/ethnicity, employee representation, and salary projection were clearly illustrated. The resulting database would then serve as input for the dashboard and end-user tool.
</p>
<h2>VALIDATION</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Data points with null values were
    dropped
    </li>
   <li>Data points with salaries below $50,000 per annum were eliminated
</li>
   <li>Columns were renamed for clarity and uniformity
</li>
  <li>Race/Ethnicity values other than White, Black, Asian, and Hispanic were eliminated</li>
</ul>
<div class="pages">
<div class="header">EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS</div>
<div class="page">
<p>We projected that the disparities within the tech industry were significant. For the purpose of this analysis, our team sampled three tech-related job titles:  “Data Scientist”, “Business Analyst'', and “Software Engineer”. We found that minorities (Blacks and Hispanics) lag behind their non-minority peers the job title of "Data Scientist" and Software Engineer. Outside of excluding potential fresh talent, lack of diversity and inclusion within the data science industry can leave current data science professionals feeling isolated, ostracized and suffering from “imposter syndrome”.

 In order to answer this question, we need a better understanding of our data accomplished by
  exploring the basic statistics of each variable and the relationships between features.</p> 

  <h2>U.S Census: Income Summary Measures by Selected Characteristics 2021</h2>

  <p>This dataset is structured with regard to income in the United States highlighting various factors such as race, household composition, age and education. Initial findings show that the dataset can be used independently as well as supplementally along with the Quick Facts dataset, as that dataset focuses primarily on the selected cities with tech hubs. Independent findings showcase median income under racial disparities across the United States for the year 2021.</p>

  <p>In this dataset, each row is uniquely identified by the “race and hispanic origin of householder by year”, “income”, and “median income”, and “mean income”  columns, meaning the dataset contains one row for each household’s reported race and relevant year, total income for each relevant year, and both median and mean income in dollars for each year. There are 100 unique rows (for race and year) and 15 unique columns for income.</p>

  <p>This dataset extracts information from Levels.fyi, a website dedicated to helping every professional build a better career through the highest integrity insights and services. The dataset presents a bulk of information based on survey response information including: race, salary (total compensation along with bonuses/stock options, education levels, years at current company, total years of experience, location, title the employee currently holds, and the company the employee currently works for. This dataset has over 42,000 unique rows and presents a wealth of information. With this dataset, we were able to answer questions on pay disparity in terms of race, location, and title for various roles in the technology industry, and customize to extract the data relevant to a specific company.</p>

<div class="header">DASHBOARD</div>
<div class="page">
  <p>The front-end dashboard provides a graphical representation of our overall business problem and provides a tool for job-seekers to determine where technology companies are located and how much they are paying their respective employees. 
    The primary stakeholders of this tool are  tech industry employers, specifically hiring managers and human resources professionals, along with current employees. Secondary users of this dashboard would include potential job-seekers and college students currently majoring in STEM fields.</p>

        <p>The correlation heatmap shows positive linear relationships between years of experience and total yearly compensation, years of experience and years working at a company, total yearly compensation and years at a company, and total yearly compensation and higher degrees. It also reveals a higher relationship between white race, bachelor's degree, and more years of experience, leading to a conclusion of a positive linear relationship between total yearly compensation and identifying as white. There is a negative correlation between higher education and BIPOC races such as black and Hispanic, leading to a negative correlation with total yearly compensation. We also see some negative correlations between the higher levels of education and the BIPOC community, such as black and Hispanic. Based on previous discoveries, we see the linear relationship between attaining a higher level degree and total yearly compensation, we can conclude that members of the BIPOC community will also have a negative correlation with total yearly compensation. There are more conclusions that can be drawn, and as we continued to delve into the levels.fyi dataset, we were able to conclude that our hypothesis was valid. </p>

<div class="header">CONCLUSION</div>
<div class="page">
  <p>The need attract and retain diverse and inclusive talent, specifically from the BIPOC communities, has been ongoing for many years. In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement and heightened public awareness about systemic racial inequalities in the United States, there has been an increased focus on attracting and retaining diverse talent in recent years. "The Color of Tech" highlights the need for increased access to STEM-related educational opportunities for the BIPOC community along with job-related training to enable "students" to transition to "employees". To reduce bias and discrimination in hiring and promotion within the tech industry, we recommend promoting diversity and inclusion efforts in hiring practices and initial salary offers. To this end, employers should consider "blind hiring" which hides resume details that may reveal a job candidate's race, gender, or socioeconomic background and potentially influence hiring decisions. Our further suggestions are to leverage social media to announce funded opportunities for technology education, training, and internships aimed at increasing minority representation in tech workspaces. We also recommend increasing access to career coaching, provide advice on salary negotiation, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers. Additionally, our findings suggest employer transparency in regards to salary range when posting new employment opportunities in order to eliminate salary underbidding for BIPOC job applicants. These recommendations aim to address the disparities in the representation, salaries, and leadership positions of BIPOC individuals in the tech industry.
