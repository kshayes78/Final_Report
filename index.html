  <div class="header">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</div>
  <div class="content">
   <h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h2>
   <p>The purpose of this project is to investigate wage inequities and the lack of BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) representation within the technology field. Based on our findings, the disparities in the data science industry are statistically significant. BIPOC employees within this career sector show significantly lower representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles in comparison to their peers of different races. In addition to excluding potentially fresh talent, the lack of diversity within the tech industry can also leave current minority technology professionals feeling marginalized and less motivated to contribute to their highest capacity within their respective departments.

</p>
<div>
<ul>
<h2>GOALS</h2>
    <li>Highlight the differences in earnings for BIPOC tech employees</li>
    <li>Investigate potential contributing factors such as education level, years of experience (YOE), and job location
    </li>
    <li>Develop an action plan for hiring managers to eliminate selection bias and increase BIPOC representation within tech fields

    </li>
    <!-- <li>Increase access to career coaching, salary negotiation techniques, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers
    </li>
    <li>Encourage employer transparency in regard to salary range when posting new employment opportunities to reduce salary underbidding</li> -->

<h2>IMPACT</h2>
    <li>Improve the number of BIPOC employees in terms of representation, salary, and attainment of senior leadership roles</li>
    <li>Increase sense of belonging in diverse talent and current technology professionals to feel less marginalized, and more motivated to contribute.
    </li>
    <li>Commitment from all levels of the organization. 
    </li>
   
   <h2>TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK</h2>

<div class="header">DATA ANALYSIS</div>
<h2>DATASETS</h2>
<p>The team identified three data sources relevant to job role, median salary, and employee demographics. We evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of each data set,
    determined the relevant factors, and performed a preliminary analysis to determine if salary inequalities were apparent.  Data sourcing proved to be challenging, and the group found that data specific to “data scientist” was quite limited relative to what we desired. For this reason, the initial project focus was amended to include additional technology roles such as software engineer and business analyst.

    </p>
<h2>DATA WRANGLING</h2>
<p>The team's primary goal during the data wrangling process was to ensure that data from various sources could be merged and that the information relevant to the relationship between race and salary expectation could be visualized. The created database would then serve as input for the dashboard and end-user tool.
</p>
<h2>VALIDATION</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Data points with null values were
    dropped
    </li>
   <li>Data points with salaries below $50,000 per annum were eliminated
</li>
   <li>Columns were renamed for clarity and uniformity
</li>
   <li>Formatted columns containing address, social media & website URLs</li>
   <li>Creating a column which specifies source of a particular dataset after merge</li>
   <li>Applied one hot encoding to product list column, to indicate availability of product for each vendor
</li>
<li>Utilized python's validator library to ensure all website URLs are valid
</li>
  </ul>

<div class="page">
<p>The front-end dashboard provides a graphical representation of our business problem. The primary stakeholders of this tool are employers, specifically hiring managers and human resources professionals within the tech industry </p>
<p>Secondary users of this dashboard would include potential job-seekers and college students currently majoring in STEM fields.</p>

<div class="header">CONCLUSION</div>
<div class="page">
  <p>"The Color of Data Science" highlights the need for increased access to STEM-related educational opportunities for the Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) community. To reduce bias and discrimination in the tech industry, the project results recommend promoting diversity and inclusion efforts in hiring practices and salary offers. Continued suggestions are leveraging social media to share funded opportunities for training and internships aimed at increasing minority representation in tech workspaces. We also found significance in increasing access to career coaching, salary negotiation techniques, and technical interview preparation for minority job-seekers. Additionally, our project encourages employer transparency in regards to salary range when posting new employment opportunities to eliminate salary underbidding for BIPOC job seekers. These recommendations aim to address the disparities in the representation, salaries, and leadership positions of BIPOC individuals in the tech industry.
